Option prices are influenced by three key factors: underlying security price, time to expiration, and implied volatility. The option price calculator allows you to input predictive parameters to calculate the reference price and break even point of an option, helping you assess price rationality, profit potential, and risk ranges in directional trade and arbitrage strategies.

## Introduction

Due to their high volatility, options have become one of the most attractive investment products in the secondary market. Although option prices can be unpredictable and ever-changing, some classic algorithmic models can provide important references for calculating future option prices. 

The underlying security price, time to expiration, and implied volatility are the three primary factors influencing option prices. By entering the three predictive parameters—date, underlying security price, and implied volatility—into the option price calculator, you can obtain the reference price of the option for that day. Whether in directional trade strategies or arbitrage strategies, the option price calculator helps you navigate the option market with confidence.

## Application scenarios

### Scenario 1: Determining whether the current price is reasonable in a one-sided long strategy

The theoretical price of an option is calculated using pricing models, while the actual price is influenced by various factors, such as market supply and demand and overall market trends, leading to a potential gap between the two. 

If you want to avoid buying options that are clearly overvalued and instead buy undervalued options, you can use the option price calculator as follows: Set the date, underlying security price, implied volatility, and risk-free interest rate to default values. The pricing model returns a theoretical option price of 204.038. Comparing this against the current market price reveals a discrepancy of just 0.48 points, indicating that the option is fairly priced and carries little risk of an immediate loss upon entry.

### Scenario 2: Assessing profit potential in a one-sided long strategy

Suppose you have learned that a certain new energy vehicle brand saw its sales surge by 50% last quarter, and you'd like to buy related options to profit. Assuming the earnings per share (EPS) growth rate aligns with the sales increase, and based on the current P/E ratio, you calculate that the stock price will likely rise to about USD 320 after the earnings report is released. To predict what price the options you're interested in will rise to by then, you can take the following steps: Set the date, implied volatility, and risk-free interest rate to default values. 

Enter 320 in the Underlying price field. The calculator returns a theoretical option price of 70.0734, representing a potential gain of 1,588.52—a compelling opportunity well worth exploring.

### Scenario 3: Identifying the break even point in a straddle strategy

The US nonfarm payrolls are about to be released. Based on your experience, if the data exceeds or falls short of expectations, it will trigger a sharp rise or fall in the S&P 500. 

However, the direction of the data—whether it will lead to a surge or a plunge— remains uncertain. Therefore, you implement a straddle options strategy: buying a call option with a strike price of 4,485 at USD 35.90, and simultaneously buying a put option with the same strike price of 4,485 at USD 8.70. We know that the profit curve for a straddle strategy is V-shaped. Point C represents the total cost of the two options at the strike price, while points A and B are the break even points where the call and put options intersect the x-axis. Profits are realized when the price exceeds point A or falls below point B. Thus, the lowest point is plotted at (4,485, -45.60) on the coordinate axis. Then, how do we determine the range between A and B? Market experience has taught us that, in most cases, the slopes of these two curves will not be the textbook-perfect 45 degrees. To obtain a more accurate break even point, the following steps are taken:

### Scenario 4: Identifying the break even point in a butterfly spread strategy

The same method can also be applied to butterfly spread strategies. If you expect that an index or stock will fluctuate within a narrow range, you can buy one low-strike call option and one high-strike call option, while simultaneously selling two middle-strike put options. This creates a profit curve similar to the one shown below. You can then use a method similar to that in Scenario 3 to determine the break even point of the curve, thereby identifying the approximate price range within which the strategy will be profitable.

Key Takeaways: By entering three key parameters—date, underlying security price, and implied volatility—into the option price calculator, you can obtain the reference price of the option for the day. This helps you assess price rationality, profit potential,and risk ranges in directional trade and arbitrage strategies. Application scenarios include determining whether the current price is reasonable in a one-sided long strategy, assessing profit potential in a one-sided long strategy, identifying the break even point in a straddle strategy, and identifying the break even point in a butterfly spread strategy.
